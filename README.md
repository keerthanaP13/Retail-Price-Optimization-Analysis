Optimizing retail prices means finding the perfect balance between the price you charge for your products and the number of products you can sell at that price.

The ultimate aim is to charge a price that helps you make the most money and attracts enough customers to buy your products. It involves using data and pricing strategies to find the right price that maximizes your sales and profits while keeping customers happy.
